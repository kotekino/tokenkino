# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

> **Read `VISION.md` first.** It is the north star — the end goal and *why* tokeniko exists (a single,
> persistent, logic-first thinking entity; a digital twin of its author; logic hardwired as the first
> axiom, all knowledge and behavior in memory). When a design decision is unclear, `VISION.md` is the
> tie-breaker; this file and the roadmap below are the tactical *how*.

Tokeniko is a **neuro-symbolic NLP engine** that compiles a natural-language sentence into a fixed-size mathematical representation ("the zip") that can be stored in MongoDB as permanent, queryable, geometrically-comparable memory. It combines symbolic parsing (POS tagging, dependency parsing, formal logical operators) with sub-symbolic fuzzy-logic vector fusion (NumPy). See `README.md` for the conceptual overview of the compilation flow.

Note: the git repository root is the **parent** directory (`../`), which also holds `scripts/` (one-off data-ingestion scripts), `atlas/` (local MongoDB data volumes), `data/`, and `doc/`. This directory (`tokeniko/`) is the installable Python package and the FastAPI app.

## Commands

Tasks are defined in `pyproject.toml` via `taskipy` (run from this directory):

- `task api` — run the FastAPI server (`uvicorn api.main:app --reload`) on port 8000
- `task brain` — run the background daemon (`python -m brain.main`)
- `pip install -e .` — editable install of the `tokeniko` package (`lib*`, `api*`)

There is **no test suite, linter, or formatter** configured. Files under `scripts/` (in the repo root) are standalone executable scripts run directly with `python scripts/<name>.py`; they populate the MongoDB knowledge-base collections (`base`, `dictionary`, `names`, `places`, `markers`, `properties`) and are not imported by the app.

### Two entry points: `api` vs `brain`

There are two distinct processes, and they have different startup requirements:

- **`task api`** (`api/main.py`) — the FastAPI server. Its lifespan calls `parser_init()`, `preparser_init()`, and `decompiler_init()`, which load the spaCy/Stanza pipelines and pull the Ollama models. It needs **all** the dependencies below to start and serve requests. This is where the full compilation pipeline runs.
- **`task brain`** (`brain/main.py`) — a background daemon (idle "thinking" loop, plus stubbed ATProto/Discord listeners). It only calls `init_io()`, so it constructs the Mongo and Ollama clients but does **not** load spaCy/Stanza or pull Ollama models on startup. In practice it needs MongoDB reachable; it does not exercise the NLP pipeline yet.

Note also that importing the `lib/llc` pipeline modules (`parser`, `preparser`, `compiler`) loads `en_core_web_lg` at **module import time**, and `translator.py` imports `transformers` at import time — so any process that imports the pipeline needs those models present.

### Runtime dependencies (must be running)

The `api` server will not start without these (the `brain` daemon only requires MongoDB):
- **MongoDB** at `MONGO_URI` (default `mongodb://localhost:27018`). Start the local Atlas container with `docker compose up -d` from this directory (`docker-compose.yml` lives here; its volumes mount the repo-root `../atlas/` data dirs). Two logical databases are used: `MONGO_DB_NAME` (knowledge base) and `MONGO_DB_NAME_MEMORY` (memory).
- **Ollama** at `OLLAMA_HOST` (default `http://localhost:11434`), used by the preparser/decompiler. Required models are listed in `lib/llc/constants.py` (`_OLLAMA_MODEL*`, `_OLLAMA_TRANS*`) and auto-pulled on startup.
- **spaCy + Stanza models**: `en_core_web_lg` (`_SPACY_MODEL`) and the `spacy_stanza` English pipeline. Stanza is run with `device="mps"` (Apple Silicon GPU).

Config is read from `.env` via `python-dotenv`. `HF_HUB_OFFLINE` / `TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE` are set so HuggingFace/MarianMT translation models load from local cache only.

## Architecture: the compilation pipeline

A sentence flows through a multi-stage pipeline. The main API entry points (`api/main.py`) — `/api/v1/input`, the axiom/definition/theorem resources, and `/api/v1/evaluate` — chain these stages:

1. **Preparser** (`lib/llc/preparser.py`, optional, `prepare=1`): typo correction (SymSpell), language detection (lingua), and translation to English (MarianMT via `lib/llc/translator.py`) before parsing. LLM-assisted via Ollama.
2. **Parser** (`lib/llc/parser.py`): `parser()` is the entry point. Uses spaCy+Stanza to dependency-parse, then builds a **recursive AST of `TKStatement` objects** (`TKStatements = list[TKStatement]`). Resolves word meanings against the MongoDB dictionary, attaches markers/operators, and produces the nested grammatical structure (subject / predicate / direct / indirects, with conjuncts, subordinates, and properties).
3. **Compiler** (`lib/llc/compiler/` package): `compiler_compile()` is the entry point (re-exported from `compiler/__init__.py`). The package is split by section — `c_entities.py`, `c_subordinates.py`, `c_statements.py`, `c_spacetime.py`, `c_zip.py`, the `c_main.py` orchestrator, and `c_state.py` (shared `_entities` map + spaCy `nlp`, reset in place per compile). Two outputs in one pass:
   - **LLC Flat** (`TKLLC`, defined in `lib/core/tkllc.py`): flattens the recursive statements into entities + references for O(1) access, resolves pronouns and implicit subjects, and computes relative spacetime.
   - **TKZip** (`TKZip`, defined in `lib/core/tkzip.py`): the final fixed-size numeric output. Applies fuzzy-logic vector fusion — advmod scalar multipliers (`_PROP_BASE_ADVMOD_ANCHORS`, e.g. "very"=1.5), Min/Max/negation/Gödel-implication operators kept in `[-1,1]`, `tanh` soft-normalization.
4. **Decompiler** (`lib/llc/decompiler.py`): `decompiler_raw()` renders LLC back to a raw symbolic string; `decompiler_decompile()` (Ollama) polishes it into natural language. Used for debugging and round-tripping.
5. **Memory store**: results are saved as Bunnet documents (`TKMemoryItemDoc`, `TKAxiomDoc`, `TKTheoremDoc`) in the memory DB, tagged with source/target stakeholder IDs and a `MEMChannels` channel.

### Fixed vector dimensions (do not change casually)

These magic numbers are enforced by Pydantic `min_length`/`max_length` constraints throughout `lib/core/`:
- **2925** — semantic vector dimensions (one per base word). Base words and dictionary senses carry a 2925-dim vector.
- **3237** — final per-role tensor in a zip = 300 logical markers + 2925 semantic + 12 spacetime.
- **8** — the spacetime bounds map (`TKZip.map`); spacetime is `[t, x, y, z]` for size/position/velocity.

Changing a dimension means updating the constraints in `lib/core/tk.py`, `tkllc.py`, `tkzip.py` *and* the data already stored in MongoDB.

## API layer (`api/`)

`api/main.py` defines the FastAPI app — only the lifespan and the thin endpoint handlers. Each handler delegates to a `*Service` and wraps the result in `{"status": "complete", "data": ...}` (and `{"status": "failed", "data": repr(error)}` on a write error). Business logic (sentence compilation + Mongo CRUD) lives in `api/services/` (one `*_service.py` per resource: `axiom_service.py`, `definition_service.py`, `theorem_service.py`, `stakeholder_service.py`, `memory_service.py`, `evaluation_service.py`), re-exported from `api/services/__init__.py` so callers can `from api.services import AxiomService`. Request/response (in/out) Pydantic models and the domain-error→HTTP mapping (`_or_http` + per-resource `*_or_http` helpers) live in `api/schemas.py`. Each service is built once in the lifespan (e.g. `app.state.axiom_service = AxiomService(tokeniko, ai_client)`, `app.state.stakeholder_service = StakeholderService()`, `app.state.memory_service = MemoryService()`) and reused per request; services are framework-agnostic (no FastAPI imports).

Routes (all under `/api/v1`):

- **Axioms — full REST resource** (`AxiomService`):
  - `POST /axioms` — compile a sentence (`{"tokens": "..."}`) and store it as an axiom
  - `GET /axioms` — list (summary projection, no `zip`; optional `?archived=` filter)
  - `GET /axioms/{id}` — single (full document, `zip` included)
  - `PATCH /axioms/{id}` — partial update (recompiles if `tokens` is supplied)
  - `PUT /axioms/{id}` — replacement update (recompile + reset flags)
  - `DELETE /axioms/{id}` — delete
- **Definitions — full REST resource** (`DefinitionService`): same shape as axioms, but each definition is a single-clause semantic statement (`TKZipContent`, not a full `TKZip`); a non-single-clause input raises `NotASingleClauseError`.
  - `POST /definitions`, `GET /definitions` (summary, optional `?archived=`), `GET /definitions/{id}`, `PATCH /definitions/{id}`, `PUT /definitions/{id}`, `DELETE /definitions/{id}`
- **Theorems — full REST resource** (`TheoremService`): derived knowledge (full `TKZip`); no `readonly` flag.
  - `POST /theorems`, `GET /theorems` (summary, optional `?archived=`), `GET /theorems/{id}`, `PATCH /theorems/{id}`, `PUT /theorems/{id}`, `DELETE /theorems/{id}`
- **Stakeholders — list/get only** (`StakeholderService`, read-only):
  - `GET /stakeholders` — list (summary projection)
  - `GET /stakeholders/{id}` — single (full document)
- **Memory — list/get/search/insert, NO update** (`MemoryService`). The `memory` collection is a Mongo **timeseries**, which forbids in-place updates — hence no PATCH/PUT/DELETE; insert is a plain log append (no compilation).
  - `GET /memory` — recent items, newest first (summary projection, no `zip`); optional `?limit=` (default 100)
  - `GET /memory/search` — filter the log (declared before `/memory/{id}` so `search` isn't read as an id): `?from=&to=` (epoch **seconds**, converted to UTC datetimes on `timestamp`; `from` is aliased, the keyword), `?source=` (`sourceId`), `?target=` (`targetId`), `?channel=`, `?limit=` — only the supplied filters apply; newest first
  - `GET /memory/{id}` — single (full document)
  - `POST /memory` — append a log entry (`original`, `sourceId`, optional `targetId`/`channel`/`metadata`)
- Domain errors map to HTTP in `main.py` via the `*_or_http` helpers: invalid-id → 400, not-found → 404.
- **Evaluate — action, not a resource** (`EvaluationService`): `POST /evaluate` (`{"tokens": "..."}`) — compile a sentence and evaluate its truth against tokeniko's knowledge. Grounds each flat clause against the definitions, **folds the clause truths through the operator tree** (fuzzy `[0,1]`, via `operator_truth`), and geometrically matches the whole statement against the active axioms/theorems. Returns an `EvaluatorResult` (`truth`, `status` = resolved/insufficient/inconsistent, `groundings`, `missing`, `relationMatch`, `matchedKind`/`matchedIndex`) plus the resolved `matchedId`/`matchedOriginal`. **Pure — stores nothing.** Loads only active knowledge (`archived=False`; NB theorems default `archived=True`, so the theorem pool is empty until one is promoted).
- **Utils** (debugging; may be removed later): `GET /utils/dict?token=` (similar-token dictionary lookup), `GET /utils/markers?token=` (base-marker lookup), `GET /utils/polish?tokens=` (typo correction), `GET /utils/prepare?tokens=` (full preparse), `GET /utils/translate?tokens=` (translation), `GET /utils/render?tokens=` (HTML dependency diagram).
- **Compiler**: `GET /input?tokens=&output=&prepare=&talker=` — run the full pipeline; returns LLC flat + recursive + raw (+ polished if `output=1`) and stores a memory item. `GET /output?tokens=` — polish a raw LLC string into natural language.

Bunnet gotcha (bit us here): `Document.get(id)` and `find_one(...)` return *query* objects — call `.run()` to execute (`.to_list()` for `find(...)`). `AxiomService._resolve` does `TKAxiomDoc.get(oid).run()`; forgetting `.run()` yields a query object that is never `None` and has no `.save()`/`.delete()`.

## Data model layers (`lib/core/`)

The type system is layered — understand which layer you're editing:

- **`tk.py`** — the recursive/symbolic layer. Pydantic models for knowledge-base entities (`TKBase`, `TKDictionary`, `TKName`, `TKPlace`, `TKMarker`, etc.), the logical operators (`TKOperator`: AND/OR/NOT/IMPLY/CONV/THAT/…), clause types, and the parser's AST (`TKStatement`, `TKFullEntity`, `TKEntityReference`). `TKStatement` holds the `create_subject`/`add_conjuncts`/`add_subordinates` factory logic that builds the tree.
- **`tkllc.py`** — the flat intermediate layer (`TKLLC` and friends): entities + references with relative spacetime.
- **`tkzip.py`** — the final numeric layer (`TKZip`): pure float vectors.
- **`models.py`** — Bunnet (`Document`) wrappers that bind the above models to MongoDB collections. Knowledge-base docs and memory docs are registered separately in `init_io()`.
- **`memory.py`** — memory-domain models (`MEMItem`, `MEMAxiom`, `MEMTheorem`, `MEMStakeholder`, `MEMChannels`). Axioms = trusted ground truths; theorems = derived knowledge.
- **`io.py`** — `init_io()` wires up both MongoDB databases (via Bunnet) and the Ollama async client. `get_tokeniko()` / `get_stakeholder()` fetch-or-create conversation participants.
- **`mappers.py`** (`TKPosMapper`), **`utilities.py`**, **`constants.py`** — helpers and `_ME_UID`/`_ME_NAME` identity constants.

### Pydantic model rebuilds

The recursive models use forward references and **discriminated unions** (`Field(discriminator='entity_type')`). After editing any recursive model in `tk.py`, `tkllc.py`, or `tkzip.py`, the corresponding `Model.model_rebuild()` calls at the bottom of the file must stay in place — they regenerate Pydantic's internal schema. Adding a new entity payload type means adding it to the `EntityPayload` / `LLCItemPayload` union *and* keeping its `entity_type` literal unique.

## Conventions

- Comments and log messages are a mix of **English and Italian**; module headers in Italian are common. Match the surrounding language when editing a file.
- Versioned modules: older implementations are kept alongside (`compilerV1.py`, `markersV1/V2/V3.py`, `scripts/legacy scripts/`). The live "V2" compiler is now the `compiler/` package (was `compiler.py`); `parser.py` (internally "V2") is the live parser.
- `lib/llc/` = the language-compilation pipeline; `lib/core/` = data models & IO; `lib/tkll/` = dictionary/token similarity search; `lib/tagger/` = tagging helpers.
- `parser.py` monkey-patches `torch.load` (`weights_only=False`) to load Stanza models — keep that patch when touching parser imports.

## Roadmap (where the team is heading)

**Memory model — three epistemic tiers** (see `memory.py` / `models.py`):
- **definitions** (`MEMDefinition` → `definitions` collection) — single-sentence, purely *semantic*
  statements defining tokeniko's vocabulary/rules ("a thing is equal to itself"). No operators; a
  definition's meaning is a single `TKZipContent`. Trusted ground truths, no demonstration.
- **axioms** (`TKZip`) — relations between definitions/vocabulary via operators ("I think because I
  am"). Trusted, no demonstration. *(NB: the current `axioms` collection predates this model and is
  "wrong" — a cleanup is parked until after the evaluator coding.)*
- **theorems** (`TKZip`) — knowledge demonstrated from definitions + axioms + the hardwired operator
  math.
- **memory** — the time-series log of inputs/outputs.

All three resources (axioms/definitions/theorems) are full REST resources backed by a `*Service`
in `api/services/`; request/response models + domain-error→HTTP mapping live in `api/schemas.py`
(`main.py` is just lifespan + endpoints).

**Evaluator / math phase** — the `lib/llc/evaluator/` package: `operators.py` (fuzzy operator
truth functions on **`[0,1]`** + `operator_truth(op, a, b)` to combine clause truths + behavioral
operator similarity), `e_compare.py` (geometric comparison: `evaluator_compareContent` /
`evaluator_compareItem` / `evaluator_compareZip`, type-routed indirects via the marker gate),
`e_truth.py` (`evaluator_groundContent`: a clause's truth in `[0,1]` vs the definitions),
`e_statement.py` (`evaluator_evaluateStatement`: ground each clause, then **fold the clause truths
through the operator tree** with `operator_truth` — `A1 IMPLY (A2 AND A3)` → `IMPLY(T1, AND(T2,T3))`
— and geometrically match axioms/theorems → `EvaluatorResult`). The evaluator is DB-agnostic — the
caller injects definitions/axioms/theorems. `EvaluatorResult`/`EvaluatorStatus` live in
`lib/core/evaluation.py`. `e_label.py` (`evaluator_assignWord`) assigns the single most
representative dictionary word to a statement — a noun-weighted semantic centroid of the role
vectors → nearest `TKDictionaryDoc` word via `$vectorSearch`. The HTTP entry point is
`EvaluationService` (`api/services/evaluation_service.py`) behind `POST /api/v1/evaluate` — the
DB adapter that loads the active definitions/axioms/theorems and maps the best match to a doc id.

Next, in rough order:

1. **Reasoning engine — the `INCONSISTENT` path (deferred, scaffolded).** The truth-folding slice
   has **landed**: `e_statement.evaluator_evaluateStatement` now folds the grounded clause truths
   through the input's operator tree (`operator_truth`) to produce the RESOLVED truth. Still to do:
   grow it to detect logic-rule violations (e.g. `(A eq B) IMPLY (B noteq A)`), produce
   `EvaluatorResult.inconsistency` (+ where), and track the missing "variables". **Design direction:
   see `doc/reasoning-engine-brainstorm.md`** (geometry = soft unification / algebra = inference;
   validity check; minimal premise+identification set; intra- then inter-statement staging).
2. **Vectorless entities / antonym representation.** `TKName` and other non-`dictionary` payloads
   carry no 2925-dim semantic vector, so distinct named entities are geometrically identical (Mari
   vs Luca). Related: antonyms aren't opposite vectors — truth-grounding "a thing is *different*
   from itself" reads ~0.79, not a contradiction. The evaluator is only as discriminative as the
   vectors.
3. ~~Confirm the operator formulas~~ — **done**: the operators in `operators.py` are now defined on
   fuzzy **`[0,1]`** per the confirmed table (AND=min, OR=max, NOT=1−a, fuzzy XOR/XNOR, Gödel
   `IMPLY`/`CONV`, `EQ=min(imply,conv)`); `operator_truth` applies them to clause truths and the
   behavioral similarity matrix is recomputed on the `[0,1]²` grid.
4. ~~Wire evaluation into an endpoint~~ — **done**: `POST /api/v1/evaluate` (`EvaluationService`)
   compiles a sentence, evaluates it against the active definitions/axioms/theorems, and returns the
   `EvaluatorResult` + the most similar axiom/theorem (id + score). Still open: include the nearest
   *memory item* in the match, and surface the `INCONSISTENT` verdict once #1 lands.
5. ~~Spacetime refinements~~ — **done**: directional operators in the evaluator are now order-aware
   (IMPLY/CONV/NOTIMPLY/NOTCONV compared positionally; symmetric ops stay bag-matched), and
   degenerate (all-zero) space axes normalize to 0 (no more `@x,-1,-1` display artifact).

Keep this list current as items land or priorities shift.
